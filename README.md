# Dnd-Tool
Current Project that is in early pre development stage
It will be an app/ website that will be used to make Dungeons and Dragons a more fluid experience for beginner Dungeon Masters.
The main focus will be making combat an easier experience to track all current information
For example, Initiative of Players and NPCs, health of NPC's and any status ailments currently in effect.

Most effects have a timer so a turn counter will be used that will tell the user whose turn it is and when a full turn has been complete, the effect timer will reduce.
